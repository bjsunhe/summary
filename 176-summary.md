Merck is set to acquire Prometheus Biosciences, a biotech firm based in California, for $10.8bn. The acquisition is a bet on the drug pra023, developed by Prometheus Biosciences to treat ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune conditions, which is approaching the late-stage of clinical trials. Merck has to replenish its drug pipeline, as patents for key treatments are set to expire, with Keytruda, Merck’s cancer-immunotherapy drug, accounting for over a third of its sales in 2022, which will face competition from cheaper copycats once key patents expire. The pharma industry faces a problem of patents for more than 190 drugs expiring before the end of the decade, leading to sales worth as much as $236bn at risk. Accordingly, pharma bosses are spending big to plug the gap, leading to a wave of consolidation across the sector, with the value of takeovers in the pharma and life-sciences industries estimated by PwC to reach $275bn in 2023, up by almost three-quarters from last year. Despite paying vast sums for drugs that are close to regulatory approval, it may take over a decade to bring a new drug to market, and many cures may fail along the way.
