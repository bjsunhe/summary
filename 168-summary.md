The traditional way of differentiating car brands based on mechanical capabilities is no longer relevant, as car buyers are looking for an enjoyable experience during their journey. Features like infotainment, advanced voice control, automatic braking, lane-keeping and changing, and adaptive cruise control matter more than slim regular gaps between the bodywork panels. Legacy carmakers are struggling to catch up with startups that focus primarily on software and Chinese firms that provide a seamless digital lifestyle extension for their customers in their cars. Software can be lucrative, with an expected $700 billion yearly revenue by 2030. Car manufacturers need to concentrate only on what they do best, while keeping control of what is bought in. Carmakers are appointing chief software officers, are presenting their software strategy during "software days," and are setting up software divisions. Big carmakers are creating new buildings to house their software engineers, with Mercedes creating a seven-story building to house a third of its 3,000 software engineers. Carmakers also need to strike deals with tech firms, which is also eyeing car manufacturers' business as a potential source of new revenues. Legacy car manufacturers should rethink their business model as software has become vital just to stand still, and the industry operates on different timescales than software, with small updates coming frequently. Car software must now be part of the smartphone ecosystem seamlessly. Still, this runs the risk of ceding users' experience to the tech companies, making the new entrants, like Tesla and other newcomers, opportunities.
