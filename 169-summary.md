Autonomous vehicles and mobility services may be creating new opportunities for firms. The promise of robotaxis was backed by data suggesting that young people are no longer so keen to own or drive cars. However, in car-mad America, only 1% of new cars are bought by people under 24, and the proportion of over-21s with licenses has hardly budged in 20 years in Britain. It's just that young people are deferring driving licenses along with settling down and having children. The average age of a new car buyer in Europe and America is also well over 50. Tesla's Autopilot's full self-driving experience is years away from widespread roll-out. In autonomous vehicles, safety drivers or remote monitoring are required. Cruise, Waymo, Uber, Amazon, Baidu, Didi, and WeRide are developing robotaxis, but these services are still in the geofenced specific area with limited operation. UBS predicts that the market for autonomous taxis could be worth $2.1tn a year in revenues by 2040. But high costs and distant profits with uncertainty over business models mean that most carmakers have less grandiose plans. The industry is focusing on level 2+/level 3, which is a hands-free, eyes-off highway driving system. McKinsey estimates that between four and six out of ten new cars may have autonomous-driving capability by 2035. It is the tech firms that may do the most to keep American and Chinese carmakers ahead. Autonomous driving should eventually change long car journeys from a chore to a better use of time.
