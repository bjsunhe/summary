The car industry has come a long way from its humble beginnings with Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886. With over 1 billion cars in the world, the industry has generated nearly $3 trillion in annual revenues. Tesla and the Chinese are now leading the industry in the next phase, marked by electrification. Lithium-ion batteries have become the key technology, with around 10.5 million EV and PHEV vehicles sold in 2022, and China alone accounting for 6.1 million sales. Tesla is the largest EV maker, selling 1.3 million EVs in 2022, while China's BYD is second, leading in terms of new energy vehicles. Electrification is changing car making by creating fewer barriers to entry for smaller brands, who can now build electric motors and batteries without having to spend vast amounts of money on ICE tech. The emphasis on software is also changing the industry, with software-defined vehicles now defined by seamless digital experiences, autonomous driving, and ride-hailing. Finally, geopolitical tensions between America and China are also challenging the industry, leading to some of the new issues that it faces. Despite this, traditional car companies have many advantages, including branding, access to capital, and a wealth of manufacturing skills. However, startups have an opportunity to create more cost-effective and adaptable products that meet new customer needs, meaning that not all traditional car firms will survive the change.
