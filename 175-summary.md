As companies go through tough times, they generally start to slash their discretionary spending. Many tech companies, such as Meta, Google, and Salesforce, have cut several benefits such as free laundry, massage therapists, and wellness retreats, respectively. These cuts in benefits are called the "perkcession." However, as the good times return, companies may reintroduce these perks, leading to the so-called "perkcovery." The definition of a good perk is that it should be dispensable, and if it cannot be cut, it is not considered a perk. In determining what perks are valuable to workers, it is challenging as employee polls may not always yield good answers. Some perks that sound great in theory may not work so well in practice. Also, perks should reinforce a company's culture; hence, they should be motivating to the widest possible group, without being a source of controversy. The framing of a perk is vital, and they work best if noticed. Some benefits, like seasonal time-limited perks, can help to keep good employees in their posts. Research into what employees value most reveals that stimulating work, recognition by managers, and good wages are employees' priority. In conclusion, while perks can assist at the margins, no employer should mistake them for the things that matter most to their staff.
