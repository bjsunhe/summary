The automotive industry is undergoing a transformation due to electrification, technology, and autonomous driving. The industry needs to reinvent itself to cope with competition from new carmakers starting from scratch or emerging from China, and new technologies demand new ways of doing business. Weaker firms, especially small Japanese makers, may not survive unless they team up with bigger ones. Some big companies may struggle to adjust their cost structures as volumes decline, except at the upper end of the market. Middling European carmakers will have the hardest job of all to fend off the Chinese, and competition is fierce. China's EV leadership lets it add European sales to those in poorer countries, which means its car firms can fight through new geopolitical tensions to crack the American market. Tesla is eating away at the market share of incumbents, and some newcomers seeking to emulate Tesla's success will manage to reach scale. The changing industry is opening the door to startups, and big tech may also have a say in the automotive industry. Overall, the automotive industry's eventual outcome may be deglobalization, which may raise costs and reduce efficiency, making cars less affordable and the industry less efficient. However, startups and new Chinese entrants will force every other carmaker to speed up electrification, bring forward software that makes journeys better, and provide more ways to use and pay for trips by car. The future may bring a new relationship with the car as a pleasant place to work and play as well as a way to get from A to B.
