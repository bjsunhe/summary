The car industry is undergoing a major shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), with even Chinese firms making inroads into the European market. Economies of scale are becoming less relevant as companies can now purchase batteries and electric motors off the shelf. Newcomers in the market are making use of Magna, a contract manufacturer, and Foxconn to reduce the risks inherent to manufacturing. The market is also becoming increasingly open to newcomers, and customers may be less loyal to established brands given that many of these companies are starting from scratch. Chinese carmakers are expected to account for more than 50% of EV sales globally by 2026. Meanwhile, it is becoming increasingly difficult for western legacy firms to switch to EVs due to high costs and low volumes, making it challenging to achieve profitability.
