Fast Retailing, the parent company of Uniqlo, has reported operating profits of Â¥103bn ($760m) in Q1 2021, up by 48% YoY, with sales in Asia (excluding home market and greater China) up by 71% over the same period. The company's expansion into South-East Asia marks a shift from its Japanese industrial peers who predominantly pursued exploration for oil and producing industrial goods in the region. Uniqlo uses automation for its business operations and supply chain, having embedded identification tags in its garments since 2017, and partnering with Mujin and Exotec Solutions in 2019 to automate its warehouse jobs. The savings from automation allowed the company to raise salaries for some employees by up to 40% in March and set pay based on global standards in future without affecting its profit margin.
