The Shanghai motor show, which opened on April 18th, attracted 1,000 exhibitors with 100 new models on show. Chinese cars, which were once poorly designed, have improved greatly in design and software, surpassing foreign counterparts in the digital experience. China is the world's biggest market for and maker of electric vehicles (EVs) and the rise of Chinese cars will be significant to replace petrol-powered cars with cleaner battery-powered ones due to global warming. Established carmakers are making radical changes to electrify, improve their software and prepare for autonomous driving as Tesla's success and greater competition in China disrupt the industry. Byd and Changan, China's two biggest homegrown firms, now have a domestic market share of 18% and sell around 4 million cars annually. Japanese carmakers, once leaders, are now left behind by Chinese competition. However, geopolitical concerns are rising, and protectionism is increasingly becoming favorable in the West. President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) encourages locals to buy domestic EV cars and components. European carmakers are calling for higher tariffs against Chinese competitors, promoting an IRA-like effort to protect the industry. Risks to privacy and national security warrant vigilance against misuse of data by carmakers, but they should not be an excuse for crude protectionism that may harm drivers. Chinese firms are racing to improve autonomous cars and make riding more pleasurable with software-enhanced screens, mood lighting, and other features. Erecting roadblocks against Chinese cars would be foolish now, just as it was foolish to try to keep out Japanese and South Korean cars.
