Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword during the earnings season, with companies using customized versions of digital tools for automation of even complex tasks. Zurich is currently using Chatgpt, a digital assistant, to read through lengthy claims documents, while Mattel is designing new toys with the help of dall-e, another AI tool. Adobe, Salesforce, and Bloomberg, too, are using generative AI tools to make life easier for their customers. A recent report by Openai, the organization behind Chatgpt and dall-e, lists the tasks that could be speeded up by over half with generative AI, making it clear that routine jobs, such as those of paralegals, financial analysts, and web designers, could be among the strongest candidates for reinvention. Despite the experimentations and progress in the field, however, companies are still ambiguous, and most tend to either overestimate or underestimate the technologyâ€™s competence. Additionally, many companies might need to rethink the role of junior staff as apprentices to be trained rather than workhorses to be whipped. Another issue is data privacy as companies need to protect sensitive data from third parties. Moreover, there is the unreliability of the technology, which has led JPMorgan Chase and Northrop Grumman to ban staff from using such tools at work. Yet, the benefits of generative AI cannot be ignored, and the technology can increase productivity across various sectors, including law, medicine, engineering, and education.
