Volkswagen (VW) seeks to transform its business model to incorporate established carmakers' strengths, for example, mass-manufacturing capability, power brands, and money, while learning from Tesla and Chinese EV startups. Philippe Houchois of Jefferies highlights that size matters to spread the industry's high fixed costs and cashflow generation for the EV transition, but it is challenging to let go of the past. Unlike Tesla's vertically integrated business model, carmakers have outsourced parts to suppliers, resulting in reduced costs but limited technological advancement. VW aims to electrify half of its sales in North America and China and 80% in Europe by 2030, but battery-making, dominated by China, Japan, and South Korea, presents a constraint on this transformation. To bypass established supply chains and trace raw materials' supply, carmakers have been signing off-take agreements directly with mining companies. Other carmakers have also started to develop in-house software for new features and functionalities, and some have begun to enter the charging business. VW has set aside â‚¬20bn ($23bn) for investments in five gigafactories by 2030, and its dedicated battery unit, PowerCo, will oversee these factories to ensure full control of its battery supply. While full vertical integration may not be economical, it is less of a barrier to success for newer firms.
