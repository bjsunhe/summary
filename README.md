Andy Saperstein, the current co-president of Morgan Stanley, is a top contender to succeed CEO James Gorman when he eventually steps down. Saperstein oversees the firm's $4.5 trillion wealth management business, which has been credited with driving the company's market value above rival Goldman Sachs. Saperstein and Gorman have led a revolution in Wall Street culture, prioritizing steady, fee-generating businesses over risky trading. The firm's move towards wealth management has made it a darling of investors and the envy of peers. Saperstein's main competition for the CEO role is co-president Ted Pick and asset management head Dan Simkowitz. While he lacks overseas experience, colleagues say his odds of becoming CEO have improved, and his relationship-building skills have been described as his secret weapon.





China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), injected the smallest amount of medium-term cash into the banking system since November, with a net injection of CNY20bn ($2.9bn) in April. The move comes as China's economy rebounds and may help stabilise borrowing costs that are under pressure to rise as demand to raise funds increases. The PBOC has now taken the action for five months in a row. Meanwhile, China's efforts to ensure there is enough liquidity in markets may mean a cut in deposit rates, encouraging profitability and more borrowing, even though smaller lenders have already reduced deposit rates this month."



China's central bank has injected the smallest amount of medium-term cash into the banking system since November 2020, providing CNY 170bn ($25bn) in funds to banks via the medium-term lending facility. The move represents a net injection of CNY 20bn in April and marks the PBOC's fifth such action in as many months. As the Chinese economy continues to recover, PBOC Governor Yi Gang has said achieving the growth target of around 5% this year is possible, thanks in part to the improved property market. China is currently focused on stabilizing borrowing costs despite small lenders cutting deposit rates in April."





The People's Bank of China injected 170 billion yuan ($25 billion) of funds into the banking system through the medium-term lending facility in April, resulting in a 20 billion yuan net injection, which was the smallest since November. The PBOC left interest rates unchanged at 2.75% for the eighth month in a row. This marks the fifth month in a row that the central bank has taken action to inject capital, as China's economic recovery appears to be on track. The PBOC is reportedly evaluating the impact of its March easing step of cutting a banking reserve ratio and providing more cash to support growth. China's growth target of around 5% this year could be achieved as the property market improves. However, immediate tightening is unlikely as the PBOC has stated that the economic recovery foundation is "not solid yet.






The S&P 500 has historically rallied after the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, however, markets might not get the same boost this time around, warn some investors and analysts. According to Goldman Sachs, going back to 1982, the S&P 500 returned an average of 19% in the 12 months after the federal-funds rate peaked. Goldman studied six Fed tightening cycles over that time period and found that stocks rose after all but one of them. However, Goldman is skeptical markets will rally again once the Fed is done with its current set of interest-rate increases. The S&P 500 trades at about 18 times its next 12 months of expected earnings, ranking in the 81st percentile for valuations going back the past 40 years, according to Goldman. The bank expects earnings growth to be almost flat for S&P 500 companies for the full year, well below the average 9% growth rate seen at the end of hiking cycles that weren't accompanied by recessions.





Historically, the S&P 500 rallied an average of 19% in the 12 months after the federal-funds rate peaked, according to a Goldman Sachs study. However, many investors and analysts are sceptical the stock market will receive the same boost this time around, with earnings growth slowing down and valuations high. The S&P 500 trades at about 18 times its next 12 months of expected earnings, ranking in the 81st percentile for valuations over the past 40 years, according to Goldman. While markets have so far appeared optimistic, the possibility of a downturn would likely influence corporate earnings to a greater degree and may impact the current market outlook.

Fed Pause Wouldn’t Necessarily Refresh Stock Market - WSJStocks have historically rallied after the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates. Markets might not get the same boost this time around, some investors and analysts warn.Going back to 1982, the S&P 500 returned an average of 19% in the 12 months after the federal-funds rate peaked, according to a Goldman Sachs team led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin. Goldman studied six Fed tightening cycles over that time period. Stocks rose after all but one of them.Yet Goldman is skeptical markets will rally again once the Fed is done with its current set of interest-rate increases. Many on Wall Street believe that the Fed might finish raising rates sometime this year.Earnings growth has faltered. S&P 500 companies are expected to report profits declining at the start of the year by the biggest amount since the second quarter of 2020. Stocks also look expensive relative to history. The S&P 500 trades at about 18 times its next 12 months of expected earnings. That ranks in the 81st percentile for valuations going back the past 40 years, according to Goldman. “There’s this great relief in the equity markets right now,” said Brad Conger, deputy chief investment officer at Hirtle Callaghan & Co. “I think that’s a mistake.”Mr. Conger said his firm has been focusing on investing in companies in industries such as healthcare, software and payment processing that look as though they’ll be able to continue increasing their profits, even if the U.S. economy cools significantly later this year, as he expects.“It’s hard to see a recession that doesn’t impact corporate earnings to a greater degree,” he said.So far, markets have appeared to shrug off the possibility of a downturn. The S&P 500 has risen 7.8% for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 16%.This coming week, investors will get a look at earnings from companies including Bank of America Corp., Netflix Inc., and United Airlines Holdings Inc., as well as fresh data on existing home sales and manufacturing activity. A big part of the reason many investors have remained optimistic is the strength of the labor market. Jobs growth, which many feared would take a sharp hit when the Fed began raising interest rates last year, has instead stayed robust. U.S. employers added 236,000 workers in March, the smallest gain in more than two years but still above prepandemic levels, Labor Department data from earlier in the month showed. “We’re in this period of calm right now because there’s clearly no sign of recession just yet,” said Jeff Schulze, director and investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.Inflation has also continued to pull back. Data the past week showed inflation in consumer goods and services rose at the slowest pace in nearly two years in March. Wholesale inflation also eased.Yet price pressures remain well above the Fed’s 2% target. That could push the Fed to keep raising rates and then holding them at high levels for longer than investors currently anticipate.Inflation is “still much too high and so my job is not done,” Fed governor Christopher Waller said in a speech Friday. The Fed needs to keep tightening monetary policy, he added.Elevated inflation is likely to weigh on earnings in the coming quarters, especially if consumers become less willing to pay higher prices for goods and services.Goldman expects earnings growth to be almost flat for S&P 500 companies for the full year. That would be well below the average 9% growth rate seen at the end of hiking cycles that weren’t accompanied by recessions, the bank said.“One of the things that’s propelling the market higher here is the strength of the economic data we’ve seen in the first quarter,” Mr. Schulze said. “But importantly, a lot of that data is lagging. It doesn’t tell us where we’re going to be in three to six months.”Some investors say that, with so much uncertainty around when the Fed will finish raising interest rates, when it will begin cutting them, and when or if a recession will materialize, it is best to focus on creating portfolios that can withstand a variety of outcomes.“I think investors often make mistakes by trying to overanalyze and overpredict market cycles…when they begin, when they end,” said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Probably more important than predicting is positioning.”Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com\n
