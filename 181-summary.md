China's property industry has been in crisis since mid-2021, with 39 companies defaulting on close to $100bn in dollar-denominated debts, leaving ordinary people without homes as companies struggle with cash flow to build them. Local officials have lost important revenue streams for land sales to developers, hindering their ability to pay their own debts and raising concerns about a greater onshore debt crisis in the future. Meanwhile, foreign bondholders have been the noisiest amid the crisis, with limited prospects of compensation. The legal structures of these foreign debts also based on Hong Kong laws, but are difficult to enforce because assets are predominantly located in China, governed by its laws. Recent restructuring plans have been presented by five companies since the start of 2022, including Evergrande and Sunac, and have mainly offered debt extensions rather than sustainable and permanent restructurings. Fitch analysts have noted that the restructuring plans so far have little encouragement, with one group of Evergrande creditors expected to wait up to 12 years for new bonds. Sunac investors have been provided with a similar deal. Both Evergrande and Sunac are also offering to swap debt for stakes in some operations, but these are risky and offer less protection than fixed-income investments if companies collapse. If the central government continues to re-establish confidence in the property market, some companies may offer better deals to offshore bondholders.
