The demand for lithium, a metal essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), has gone through a period of significant growth, with prices skyrocketing over the past two years, boosted by the increasing popularity of EVs in markets such as China. However, the market has since slowed down, with Chinese lithium carbonate prices falling by more than half in 2019 due to a lack of EV demand and carmakers having signed battery supply deals at high prices then reviewed them. Additionally, global mined lithium supply is on the rise, with production having grown by 1% in 2022 and expected to increase by almost a fifth this year as large mines are brought online in Australia and Chile. This, combined with the decreasing demand for EVs, has caused the valuations of major lithium miners SQM and Albemarle to fall, although experts predict that, given lithium is still expensive compared to past levels, it is unlikely to fall further enough to seriously dent demand for lithium or the profits of the larger mining firms. If prices fall below a certain point, many Chinese domestic mines will be forced to shut down, which will reduce the supply levels.
 
Even as the price of refined lithium has dropped, the price of spodumene, a feedstock used to transform lithium ore, remains high, forcing processors to lower production and supporting the price of the refined version. Despite this, lithium miners, such as Albemarle, are continuing to move forward with new projects, and there are signals that demand will increase. For instance, JPMorgan Chase has predicted that a rebound will tip the lithium market into a deficit in 2023 and 2024. The market is also expected to tighten further due to a rising demand for lithium for energy storage, supported by green policies in regions such as America, Europe and China. Carmakers are anxious to secure a greater supply of lithium, with General Motors pledging in April to invest in a startup that aims to extract lithium from previously ignored deposits. However, if prices recover, as insiders expect, carmakers may be disappointed, as they will make EV batteries more expensive, thus pushing up the cost of EVs themselves.
