Forecasting the post-pandemic economy is challenging as uncertainties are increasing quicker than ever before. Despite banking industry chaos, analysts believe that the world economy is going through difficult times with a hard-landing recession being more probable than no-landing scenario, mild recession, or untroubled economy by a potential increase in interest rates. In 2021, the economic growth predictions were twice as wide-ranging as 2019, while the IMFâ€™s latest global economic outlook mentions uncertainty over 60 times, around 2x more than in the earlier months. The current economic picture is challenging for official statisticians too, with GDP revisions in the EU being four times bigger than previously. With more profound changes at play, the world is now much more volatile, making comparisons harder. The pandemic and the political-economic situations have contributed to the changes, making it hard for officials to get accurate economic statistics. As confidence in the government decreases, non-response bias continues to distort the accuracy of data. Because of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, many businesses closed, and there has been growing resistance to reporting personal data, reducing sample sizes, resulting in increased data volatility and bias. Finally, the discrepancy between "hard" and "soft" economic data, reflecting the differing levels of unemployment and people's future expectations, makes it even harder to evaluate the post-pandemic world as it continues to be sfumata, like Mona Lisa.
