EY has decided to indefinitely delay plans to separate its audit and advisory businesses due to concerns from its American branch. One sticking point has been the division of the tax practice, which both auditors and advisers covet. Plans to publicly list the advisory business and load it with debt to pay off audit partners also looked cleverer when the deal was conceived amid low interest rates and frothy share prices. This suspension is a big blow to EY’s global bosses, who have underestimated how difficult "Project Everest" would prove to be. The case against turning the big four into a biggish eight is far from open and shut. The opportunity to dabble in different service lines has helped the big four entice the bright-eyed young things their businesses rely on. A career in bean-counting looks more appealing when it comes with the opportunity to work on big acquisitions or advise governments on important matters. Expertise in areas such as tax and valuations has helped the likes of KPMG and the others solidify their position as auditors-of-choice for large companies. The big four’s breadth has helped them win over clients, while widely recognised audit brands have boosted the reputation of the firms’ advisory arms. The multidisciplinary model has also helped PwC and the other professional-services giants adapt to the digital era. Staying together may no longer be good for attracting talent, either. Few bosses want to receive cybersecurity advice from a fresh-faced accountant. The problems are on display in a string of much-publicised audit snafus. They could also lead to greater pressure from regulators to invest more in auditing, particularly around fraud detection. The advisers are getting increasingly capital-hungry—they want to expand into managed services and they need new technology to do so. An advisory spin-off would leave the auditors flush with cash while freeing the consultants to pump themselves up with fresh equity from outside their partnerships. Accenture, which emerged from the rubble of Arthur Andersen, has thrived since then, now raking in $62bn a year in sales.
