Development-finance institutions (DFIs) that finance businesses and create jobs by lending money and buying stakes in firms are becoming a popular choice for cash-strapped governments. DFIs are yet to prove themselves to meet their ambitions for the world's poorest places. DFIs often seek cheap co-financing from donor agencies that offer grants or concessional loans to minimize the risks related to failure of firms. Though DFIs make modest profits, they have created jobs and are increasingly allocating their funds to energy projects, such as solar panels and hydroelectric dams. Nonetheless, businesses in developing countries need equity to be able to stand risks, as it provides lasting capital. However, only a few DFIs deal with equity investments. Governments, as primary shareholders, need to understand the specific purpose of DFIs and be realistic about the outcomes of their investments, bearing in mind challenging issues such as political insecurity or a lack of contract enforcement.
