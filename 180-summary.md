American banks are examining the damage from the financial storm that followed the sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank, the countryâ€™s 16th-largest lender, as well as two other banks. American listed banks must disclose their balance sheets and earnings once a quarter, offering a view of the damage. Results season for banking began on April 14th with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo reporting. This season will be closely watched through to April 24th, when First Republic, a bank in San Francisco, will belatedly disclose its results. JPMorgan Chase, with $3.7tn in assets, is doing well, but damage hasn't struck each part of the banking industry equally. PNC is paying more for its deposits, and while the deposit base at Western Alliance Bancorp, an Arizona-based lender, ended the first quarter up, the bank's profits fell 50%. It is too early to say if further revelations will expose the full extent of the damage.
