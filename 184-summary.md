Yi Gang, the governor of China's central bank who holds an economics Ph.D. from the United States and who advocates for economic liberties and market forces, discussed his monetary policy approach during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Yi expressed a desire to give private firms and households the maximum amount of freedom and to not intervene in currency markets. However, Yi admitted that uncertainty due to the difficulty of calculating growth rates leads him to try and keep real interest rates below China's potential growth rate. Yi's adherence to this guideline receives criticism, as Edmund Phelps' "golden rule" of saving and investment suggests that interest rates should align with the marginal product of capital when economies accumulate to the point where their marginal product equals the underlying growth rate. However, central banks do not control the marginal product of capital and Chinese monetary policymakers' "attenuation" principle formalized by William Brainard of Yale University suggests doing less if policymakers are uncertain about the effects of their policies. Some critics argue that such cautious policymaking creates a more persistent misalignment of inflation. Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute commented that, despite the success of China's monetary policy, Yi's hesitant approach might not be the reason. Due to China's aggressive containment of the pandemic in 2020, the central bank did not need to cut interest rates as much as the U.S. Federal Reserve, creating stability in the country's interest rates. Furthermore, China's commitment to zero-covid policies postponed inflation-related interest rate hikes.
