Despite early experimentation with batteries in the 1830s, electric vehicles lost ground to petrol-driven vehicles due to mass production and the growth of the oil industry. However, Tesla's arrival in 2003 marked the beginning of the battery-electric revolution that has resulted in EVs and PHEVs accounting for 13% of new-car sales in 2022, with Bloomberg nef estimating that EVs will account for nearly a quarter of sales by 2025 and around three-quarters of new-car sales worldwide by 2040. Tough emissions regulations in Europe, China, and the US are pushing for a switch to electric vehicles, with the EU possibly banning new ICE cars by 2035, and China mandating that 20% of cars must be NEVs by 2025 and a complete transition by 2035. Carmakers are investing around $1.2tn by 2030 to produce more EVs, with GM planning to go all-electric by 2035, Ford's European arm by 2030, and Stellantis targeting all new cars in Europe and half its American output to be EVs by 2030. Volkswagen and Audi also plan to switch to EVs by 2033. The biggest deterrents to buying an electric car - price and range - are slowly being overcome due to new tech, scaling, and a decrease in battery prices. With generous subsidies and more models to choose from, EVs will soon be cheaper than ICE cars both in terms of sticker price and running costs.
