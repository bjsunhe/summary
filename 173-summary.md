As Apple faces political and logistical difficulties in China, the company is expanding its presence in India by opening its first retail stores and shifting some of its manufacturing operations there. With India expected to become the world's most populous country and a growing consumer of tech gadgetry, Apple sees India as a new strategic market. Although Apple's products are too expensive for most Indians, as they get richer, they are upgrading their handsets. In the year to March, Apple's revenues in India were almost $6bn, up by nearly 50% from the previous year, and Wedbush Securities predicts that its Indian revenues could reach $20bn by 2025. Meanwhile, India is seen as a future export base as the government offers subsidies and the country is increasingly capable of manufacturing tech products. It is saidÂ that a quarter of iPhones will be made outside China, in India, by 2025. Apple is also eyeing manufacturing opportunities in Vietnam and Thailand. Despite shifting some final assembly of its products to other countries, Apple still relies on China's supply chains for components. The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, played down the idea that the company is deserting China, and he also recently visited Beijing to maintain relationships with the country.
