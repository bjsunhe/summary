Foreign carmakers are learning from Chinese firms, but China's hopes of selling millions of cars abroad may struggle due to a deteriorating political landscape. Growing nationalist sentiment among Chinese buyers and greater efforts by the government to encourage domestic firms are making China a more challenging place to do business. Car manufacturers are reconfiguring supply chains to make them less exposed to geopolitical concerns, with reliance on China a growing issue. America's efforts to block Chinese firms from advanced technology and Europe's plans to respond to America's incentives may cause the deglobalisation of the car industry. A more regionalised, more protected, and hence less efficient car industry would not be a better one. Chinese hopes may fall foul of geopolitical tensions, new trade barriers, a subsidy race, shifting supply chains, and tighter restrictions on access to Western technology and data-sharing. Russia's attack on Ukraine shows how fast a country with a small car industry can be affected; Western car firms with manufacturing plants suspended operations or pulled out entirely. Rising tensions with China would affect many industries besides cars.
