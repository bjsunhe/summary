Shares in three of Japan’s five largest trading conglomerates have reached record highs following an announcement by Warren Buffett that he is keen to own more of their stock. The trading firms Berkshire Hathaway has invested in, which are known in Japan as sogo shosha, are often seen as stodgy and reliable with price-to-earnings ratios of below ten and healthy dividends. Even before Berkshire Hathaway's recent issuance of around $1.2bn in yen-denominated bonds, nearly a fifth of its debt was denominated in yen because of the advantages of currency hedging. Borrowing in yen protects Mr Buffett from falls in the currency’s value, and he can finance his investments using long-term loans charging less than 2% annually while keeping his spare cash at home invested at almost 5%. The appeal of currency hedging today is irresistible, as borrowing in yen is so cheap relative to doing so in dollars, making the trade a no-brainer for investors with even a passing interest in Japanese stocks. Those investors who cannot easily issue yen-denominated bonds may exploit the monetary-policy gap with more straightforward currency hedges. The surge in American but not Japanese interest rates means that Japanese investors are paying an enormous premium to buy American assets and protect themselves from currency movements. The yen currently trades at 134 to the dollar, but currency-futures maturing in March next year give investors the opportunity to sell at 127 to the greenback, locking in a 5% return over little less than a year. For investors who want to own Japanese stocks, the return to hedging is essentially a bonus. MSCI Japan Hedged index, based on the returns of Japanese stocks employing one-month-rolling-currency forwards, is up by 12% over the past year when the MSCI USA index provided negative returns. Some big names are beginning to take advantage of the Japanese bonus. Elliott Management, an activist investor, has been rewarded for its intervention in Dai Nippon Printing, and Citadel, an American hedge fund, is reopening an office in Tokyo after staying away for the past 15 years.
